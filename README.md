A Lemmy API Client built with Dart. Continuation of the original [Lemmy Dart API](https://github.com/LemmurOrg/lemmy_dart_client) and [Liftoff Dart API](https://github.com/liftoff-app/lemmy_dart_client).

## Information
Updates are done at a best-effort basis to ensure compatibility with the current major version of Lemmy. Due to the unstable nature of Lemmy API, there will be limited support for the last major version.

Notice: While efforts are made to keep as much parity as possible with the Lemmy API, it is not guaranteed. If a particular endpoint or feature is missing, feel free to create a feature request or a pull request implementing that endpoint.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:fediverse_client/v3.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Initialize the Lemmy API Client with the given instance URI
  const lemmy = LemmyApiV3('lemmy.ml');

  // Fetch posts
  final response = await lemmy.run(const GetPosts());

  print(response);
}
```

## Conventions
When implementing a new endpoint, try to follow the existing conventions. A basic summary of these conventions are mentioned below.

### API Methods and Naming
Any high-level API methods should be placed under `/api` directory matching the endpoint. For example, `GET /community` should be placed under `api/community/community.dart` file.
- Always attempt to match the naming of the API or model with the [official API client](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client). This helps with parity checking and general organization.

### Deprecating Fields
When a field or attribute is being deprecated in the upcoming version of Lemmy, mark it as such by **annotating the field with `@deprecated`** and making the field **optional**.

This example shows deprecation for the `community` field. Whenever possible, add an additional comment on which API version deprecates the field
```dart
const factory CommunityView({
  required Community community,
  required SubscribedType subscribed,
  required bool blocked,
  required CommunityAggregates counts,
}) = _CommunityView;
```

```dart
const factory CommunityView({
  @deprecated Community? community, // v0.18.0 (required) [deprecated in v0.43.0]
  required SubscribedType subscribed,
  required bool blocked,
  required CommunityAggregates counts,
}) = _CommunityView;
```

### Adding Fields
When a field or attribute is introduced in an upcoming version of Lemmy, keep that attribute **optional** regardless of what the Lemmy API version denotes, and denote whether the field is optional/required. This is to ensure compatibility with the current and upcoming version of Lemmy. Furthermore, add a comment to denote which version introduces that field.

This example shows addition for the `follow` field:
```dart
const factory CommunityView({
  required Community community,
  required SubscribedType subscribed,
  required bool blocked,
  required CommunityAggregates counts,
}) = _CommunityView;
```

```dart
const factory CommunityView({
  required Community community,
  required SubscribedType subscribed,
  required bool blocked,
  required CommunityAggregates counts,
  bool? follow, // v0.64.0 (required)
}) = _CommunityView;
```
